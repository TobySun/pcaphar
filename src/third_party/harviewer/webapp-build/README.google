Description:

HAR Viewer is a web application (PHP + Javascript) that allows to visualize
HTTP tracing logs based on HTTP Archive format (HAR). These files contain
recorded information about HTTP traffic performed by web pages. A HAR log can
be created by HTTP sniffer tools such as Firebug.

Local Modifications:

1. Removed the PHP code from the project, because Google AppEngine does not
support PHP.

2. Changed phaseInterval scripts/preview/requestList.js from 1000 to 1000000000
to prevent auto-wrap of resource start timings.
